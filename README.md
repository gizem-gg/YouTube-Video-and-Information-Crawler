# YouTube-Video-and-Information-Crawler

First, one can find how to scrape YouTube videos using YouTube Data API v3 with also a "next-page" capability since there is a limit
to scrape videos for one request. 
Please note that in order to user YouTube Data API, first API keys need to be generated from the Google Cloud Console for free.

Second this project can also be used to crawl a given YouTube video's description and subtitles (manually or automatically generated)
using a videoID.
